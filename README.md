# ✨ Welcome to my profile!
I'm a health science researcher who found in technology a better way to solve problems.

## 👩🏽‍💻 I’m currently learning another way to work with Data Science.

👩🏻‍🔬 My research background was analysis of physical exercise effects as a treatment for clinical problems.
<br> Nowadays, I've been focusing on learning programming logic to become a **Data scientist**. I already program with **JavaScript** and **Python**. I also have experience with data visualization at **PowerBI**.

## 🏋🏽‍♀️🫀 I’m looking to collaborating with companies who have the same interests as me.
I want to use my knowledge **+** my learning capacity to grow in a company that believes in better health with data science and new technologies.
